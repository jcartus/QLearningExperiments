# QLearningExperiments
This repo contains little experiments with simple examples of reinforcement learning.

# The game 
To be exact I created a little minigame, 
where the player needs to move on an n-dimensional grid from the start position to the goal
While avoiding a few deadly obstacles.

Instead of struggling myself I set up an agent, 
which learns to master this mini-game via basic Q-learning.
